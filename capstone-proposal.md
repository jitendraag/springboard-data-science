#Capstone Project Idea#

1. What is the problem you want to solve?

I want to predict whether a loan should be approved for an application or it should be declined based on data from following dataset:

Alternatively, I can predict whether a 'disbursed loan' will turn out be a bad loan. Some of the other elements like credit limit or interest rate can also be evaluated.

2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

My client is the asset disbursement and credit risk team within the lending business. My client would choose whether a loan should be disbursed (depending on their risk apetite).

3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

Historical 'real' data is available from LendingClub - https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action

4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

I have no clue at this moment; I am assuming I will look at the difference between approved and declined loans, good vs. bad loans and then build a model that will use different parameters to find out how 'close to' a new application is when compared to good or bad loans.

5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

Code along with a description of some of the methods (failed, successful) that I tried.
